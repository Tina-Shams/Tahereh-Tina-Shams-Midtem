        Set in France during the early nineteenth century, the film tells the story of Jean Valjean
         who, while being hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman Javert after breaking parole,
          agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The story reaches resolution against the 
          background of the June Rebellion of 1832.
